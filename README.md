# teen-smart
Team Repository

Getting started notes:
Use ipconfig to get the computer's address, and update it in auth0-credentials
Run mongod.exe with the proper teen-smart db, and surveys and users collections
Go into both the front-end and back-end folders and run npm start in separate windows. Once both have started, the app should function.
